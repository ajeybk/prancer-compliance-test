title: AWS SNS topic with server-side encryption disabled

description: This policy identifies Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics that have server-side encryption disabled. As a best practice, enable server-side encryption for at-rest encryption of message content published to SNS topics. When you publish a message, the SNS encrypts your message as soon as it receives it, and decrypts it just prior to delivery.
